# message-app
I use to make this message-app : react, firestore-database, firebase-auth, firestore, react-hooks, axios, react-router-dom and context-API.<br>
This chat engine work perfectly. if you use this message app then you create an account and chat with your friend. active status have also this message-app but no groups are availible here . only one to one message
